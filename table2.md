The voting explorer above displays a list of proposals that have been approved for grant, rejected or are still waiting for a voting resolution, which will take 7 days from the time the proposal was approved for voting. As can be seen from the image below, all three voting parameters (i.e. 'veto (V), 'threshold (T)' and quorum (Q)) must all be passed. The formula for calculating all voting parameters are clearly shown in the image.
